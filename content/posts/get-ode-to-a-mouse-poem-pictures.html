    <p>Competition&#039;s caste, a fickle fate. Born in 1795, john keats was an english romantic poet and author of three poems considered to be among the finest in the english language. Like &#039;daffodils or &#039;sonnet 18&#039;, we barely read it anymore, the title is shorthand for what we think it says. An ode is a short lyric poem that praises an individual, an idea, or an event.</p>
