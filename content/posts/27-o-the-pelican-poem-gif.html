                I double checked the first fourteen listings in a google search of the first line of the limerick and of the 7. It is strangely proportioned with very short legs for the size of its body. A wonderful bird is the pelican, his bill will hold more than his belican, he can take in his beak enough food for a week but i&#039;m damned if i see how.
