description: "How did my heart not burst, the breakers strike blow after blow not break, o god into a thousand pieces lies veiled and bleak, the sun&#039;s departure mournings lights a sufferer&#039;s face and that is born of the god like pride of anguish like a in passion&#039;s savage blindness she callously destroy&#039;s my life."
