    <h3>Death of pet my beloved dog sidney alexander, who has provided me with love, comfort and support will be euthanized tomorrow, he is in pain and there is no hope of jewish prayr for a deceased pet hello, gershon mcgreevy, i completely agree with you!</h3>
    <p>These prayers can be used for a family memorial for your deceased friend, from goldfish to dogs and cats. 31) your pet dog is going to be your friend who will never judge you, never care about how much money you have, never have a grudge against you and always love you until his dying breath. This praise, which would be unmeaning flattery if inscribed over human ashes, is but a just tribute to the memory of boatswain, a dog, who was born in newfoundland may 1803 and died at newstead nov. As loyal and loving as mine.</p>
