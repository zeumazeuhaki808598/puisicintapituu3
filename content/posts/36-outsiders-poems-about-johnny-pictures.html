                That poem, the guy that wrote it. She is my idol, and amazingly awesome! When johnny said stay gold ponyboy, stay gold. i think he was telling pony to keep wondering and watching sunsets.

    <p>But he explains in a pleading, high voice that he just doesn&#039;t want johnny to get hardened in jail. In this moment, johnny shows a tender, sensitive, and emotional side, as well as the depth of friendship and loyalty he gives to and shares with ponyboy. Pony always seems to have his head just in a little bit up in the after i read the end of the outsiders, i started watching sunsets and i don&#039;t think i had ever really watched a sunset before. When ponyboy and johnny are hiding at the church, they watch a sunrise, which reminds pony of robert frost&#039;s 1923 poem, nothing gold.</p>
