                Arthur sze, sight lines from sight lines. I love thee to the level of every day&#039;s most quiet need, by sun. In flows a peach with only one bite taken out of it, but in flows, too, the body of a stiff mouse half cooked by the heat of the stove it was toughening under.
    </p>

    <h3>She might be outta my sight but never off of my mind and if she asked me for the world than i would offer her mine without a thought or a care of the cost upon i i&#039;d pay the loss of an eye and wear the patch with a passion as a badge.</h3>
    <p>For our purposes here, it&#039;s primarily a matter of cultural ubiquity, though i guess i lost sight of the original list, wandering through all these interesting comments. Sight word poems (the third set). I love thee to the depth and breadth and height my soul can reach, when feeling out of sight for the ends of being and ideal grace. Bright eyes and a ray of sunshine.</p>
